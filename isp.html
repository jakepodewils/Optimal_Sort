    <h1>This is my ISP!</h1> 
    <h2>Our ISP was to create a game with a group of classmates, and to finish it by the end of the semester. For our game, we chose HangMan!</h2>

<h2>This is a little sample image of what the game looks like. The theme of this version of hangman is countries, and players have a total of 8 lives, as each letter lost is a body part of the hangman.</h2>

<h2>This is the function that corresponds with when to end the game. It tracks the amount of guesses that have been incorrect, and when that number hits 8, it will automatically stop the game, and tell you the country. If you end up getting the coutnry before the 8 guesses, it tells you that you won, and if you would like to try another round!</h2>
<h3>Overall, this isp project I had at the end of my CSI year was incredibly benefitial to me, because it got me to feel like I was working a real life project, and that I had to work with colleagues to finish it by a certain deadline!</h3>

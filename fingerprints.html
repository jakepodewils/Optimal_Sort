    <h1>Fingerprints</h1>
    <h2>   This is an essay over the many different ideas of digital fingerprints. For one, the two primary purposes of a secure https connection is to keep the user safe when inputting classified information in, such as bank account info, while the other purpose of the secure https connection is to authenticate the user who is accessing the information, and making sure that the correct person is looking at the correct information. Since we are on the topic of secure https connections, let me introduce you to a HTTPS Proxy Appliance. An HTTPS Proxy Appliance is something that is able to navigate around our most basic idea, and guarantee internet browser safety. Basically, this is something that can act as a firewall, and protect bad things from going into your computer. It goes ahead and grabs the information, sends it to the website, retrieves the websites info, and give it back to you. It almost acts as a middle man in this situation. Although this HTTPS Proxy Appliance is great for security, this can be taken advantage of. MITM stands for man in the middle, and this is a type of attack where someone acts almost as a proxy server, but instead, he keeps the information and can take advantage of someone inputting information such as bank account info, etc.</h2>
    <h2>   A hash is a complex mathematical algorithm that can carefully digest and process every single bit of information that they receive. The essential qualities that can make it a good hash, is when you change only one bit, at least half of the fingerprint will change in the process! This allows for different digital fingerprints to be created, even while making micro changes with your information. The CA, otherwise known as a "certificate authority" is one of the most important parts in a digital fingerprint. These are entities to whom websites has proved their identity, the CA proves the certification by signing the site's security site.</h2>
    <h2>   SSL Interception cannot be prevented, as it is incredibly easy to access most websites and intercept the data, giving them access to things such as personal bank accounts, and basically anything that you input onto the computer. Since we know that SSL interception cannot be prevented, lets go through the ways to detect it. SSL Interception can be detected, as every duplicate website that people try to make will be made radically differently. You will be able to check the fingerprint, and if the fingerprint is different from the real website, then they can detect that this is a fake website, and a fake domain.</h2>
    <h2>   A False Positive is when you input two different websites that are spelled differently, but the same website, and the fingerprint will look the exact same. This is known as a false-positive because you can think that you have the right fingerprint, but in reality, it is a false-positive, and you have an entirely wrong fingerprint.</h2>
    <h2>   I understand the school's intentions in trying to eavesdrop on student's communications, but I do not think that is morally correct to eavesdrop on anything the student does. Everyone has a right to privacy, and everyone has a right to be able to feel comfortable with what they are saying, and not feel like someone is watching over their shoulder every second of the day.</h2>

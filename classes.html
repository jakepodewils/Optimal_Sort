    <center> <h1>Fundamentals of Computer Science!</h1> </center>
    <center><h2>Fundamentals of Computer Science was an incredibly fun intro class to computer science, where I was able to learn more about how computers work, and what computer science truly is. We ended up using multiple languages during this time, such as java for the first half of the year, and python for the second half. Overall, this was a great starting class that started to introuce me to computer science, and show me what I was truly getting myself into!</h2></center>
    <center><h1>Computer Science I!</h1></center>
    <center><h2>Computer Science I was a completely different story compared to Fundamentals of Computer Science, as there was way more projects that we had to do on a weekly basis, and we had to learn swift, rather than using python or java, which we learned back in Fundamentals of Computer Science. Computer Science I definitely had it's ups and downs, but overall, I think the class was good for me. Sometimes, I would struggle to finish my code before the deadline, which would really ruin my grade, as that is an automatic zero, but other times, I felt like I was on top of the world, being able to finish any code I was assigned, incredibly easily, and feeling like a master coder.</h2></center>
    <center><h1>Computer Science II!</h1></center>
    <center><h2>Currently, I am enrolled in Computer Science II, and it has been less than a month since I started this class. Over the year, I will eventually start adding more and more detail into this paragraph, and eventually at the end of the year, have a description of what I did during the year, how I felt about it, etc etc!</h2></center>
